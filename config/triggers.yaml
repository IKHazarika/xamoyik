# Time-sensitivity triggers for Assamese Wikipedia tagging bot
# Philosophy:
# - Prefer high-precision triggers over high-recall.
# - Avoid triggers that would tag historical biographies or timeless topics.
# - Use Wikidata only when we are confident; otherwise rely on enwiki infobox/category signals.

aswiki:
  # Assamese categories: exact match only (high precision).
  # These are meant to catch obvious time-sensitive articles when Wikidata is missing.
  category_exact:
    # Biographies
    - "জীৱিত ব্যক্তি"          # living people

    # Places (demographics, governance, infrastructure change)
    - "দেশ"
    - "ভাৰতৰ ৰাজ্য"            # if exists; adjust to your category system
    - "ৰাজ্য"
    - "জিলা"
    - "চহৰ"
    - "গাঁও"
    - "নগৰ"
    - "পৌৰসভা"

    # Organizations / institutions
    - "বিশ্ববিদ্যালয়"
    - "বিদ্যালয়"
    - "হাসপাতাল"

    # Economy / firms
    - "কোম্পানী"
    - "ব্যাংক"

    # Politics
    - "ৰাজনৈতিক দল"

    # Sports
    - "ক্ৰীড়া দল"              # if exists; adjust
    - "ফুটবল ক্লাব"            # if exists; adjust

  # Assamese templates: exact match only (high precision).
  # Put only templates that *strongly* imply time-sensitive content.
  template_exact:
    # A true "living person" / BLP marker if you use one
    - "জীৱিত ব্যক্তি"

    # If Assamese Wikipedia uses infoboxes, these can help.
    # Keep these only if they exist on aswiki; otherwise remove.
    - "দেশ"            # infobox country (example—adjust)
    - "চহৰ"            # infobox settlement/city (example—adjust)
    - "কোম্পানী"        # infobox company (example—adjust)
    - "বিশ্ববিদ্যালয়"   # infobox university (example—adjust)

wikidata:
  # IMPORTANT CHANGE vs your old file:
  # - We DO NOT include Q5 (human) here, because that tags historical figures.
  # - Instead we use living_human_rule for living humans only.
  #
  # Keep this list minimal and only for entity-types that are inherently time-sensitive.
  # (Countries/settlements/orgs/companies/universities typically change over time.)
  p31_qids:
    - "Q6256"   # country
    - "Q515"    # city
    - "Q783794" # company
    - "Q3918"   # university

  # If true: tag humans ONLY if they appear living
  # (human + no death date in Wikidata).
  living_human_rule: true

enwiki:
  # English categories: exact match only where possible.
  # Avoid broad categories like "Countries" (too messy on enwiki),
  # and avoid any birth/death-year category logic.
  category_exact:
    # Living people (core)
    - "Living people"

    # Ongoing / current events (rare but strongly time-sensitive)
    - "Ongoing military conflicts"
    - "Ongoing conflicts"
    - "Current wars"
    - "Active insurgencies"

  # English category prefixes: keep only those that strongly indicate a continuously-updating topic.
  # DO NOT include "202" or year prefixes (those tag historical people).
  category_prefix:
    - "Elections in "
    - "Ongoing "

  # English templates: exact match only (high precision).
  # This is the main way to infer time-sensitive topics when aswiki lacks categories.

    - "Infobox settlement"
    - "Infobox administrative division"
